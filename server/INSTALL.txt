# Note: libfreenect won't build with Clang as at 2012-03-12, so if you're on Lion with no real GCC:
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/apple-gcc42.rb
brew edit libfreenect  # add 'ENV.gcc' as the first line of the install method (i.e. straight after 'def install')
###

brew install libfreenect

cd ~/src
wget https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tarball/master
tar xvzf master
cd OpenKinect-libfreenect-bac62d0/wrappers/python
sudo python setup.py install
